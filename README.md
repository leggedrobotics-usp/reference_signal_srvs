## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This repo contains the service definitions for reference signal generations, required by the [reference_signal_generator](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_generator) package.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
This repo is a ROS1 package (catkin) dedicated to service interface definitions. Learn more about ROS services in the [ROS documentation](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingServicesParams).

### üõ† Prerequisites

- A ROS1 workspace (catkin)
    - See [this tutorial](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment) to learn how to create your own workspace.

### üíª Installing

As mentioned above, this repo is a standard ROS package. Thus, you simply have to clone it inside your workspace's **src** directory, making sure to use the **ros1** branch.

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros_ws>/src
git clone -b ros1 https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_srvs.git
```

Then, use **catkin** to build (**catkin build** example shown, **catkin_make** also usable)

```bash
cd <path_to_your_ros_ws>
catkin build reference_signal_srvs
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Service message definitions (.srv files) are not directly usable by themselves. The [reference_signal_generator](https://github.com/leggedrobotics-usp/reference_signal_generator) package uses this repo's definitions to spawn services that trigger actual signal generation in a chosen ROS topic.

You can also use the definitions of this repository to build other packages related to control signal generation.

The goal of this service is to trigger a reference signal with an arbitrary number of inputs (or DOFs). Thus, most arguments are array-type. They must all have the same length.

### Request arguments

- ``string[] signal_type`` String array describing the desired signal type for each input. Supported values are ``"step", "ramp", "sine", "square", "triangle", "sawtooth", "chirp"``.
- ``float64[] initial_value`` Numeric array describing the initial value for each input. Applies to Step and Ramp signals.
- ``float64[] final_value`` Numeric array describing the final value for each input. Applies to Step signals.
- ``float64[] start_time`` Numeric array describing the time (seconds) at which each input will be started. Applies to all signals.
- ``float64[] end_time`` Numeric array describing the time (seconds) at which each input will stop. Applies to all signals. Supports ``inf`` for continuous publishing.
- ``float64[] slope`` Numeric array describing the slope for each input. Applies to Ramp signals.
- ``float64[] offset`` Numeric array describing the DC offset for each input. Applies to Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth and Chirp signals.
- ``float64[] amplitude`` Numeric array describing the total amplitude for each input. Applies to Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth and Chirp signals.
- ``float64[] frequency`` Numeric array describing the waveform frequency (Hz) for each input. Applies to Sine, Square, Triangle and Sawtooth signals.
- ``float64[] phase`` Numeric array describing the phase shift (degrees) for each input. Applies to Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth and Chirp signals.
- ``float64[] initial_frequency`` Numeric array describing the frequency (Hz) at ``t = start_time`` for each input. Applies to Chirp signals.
- ``float64[] target_frequency`` Numeric array describing the frequency (Hz) at ``t = target_time`` for each input. Applies to Chirp signals.
- ``float64[] target_time`` Numeric array describing the time (seconds) at which the chirp frequency will linearly reach ``target_frequency`` for each input. Applies to Chirp Signals.
- ``float64 publish_rate`` Number describing the rate (Hz) at which the topic will publish the reference signal.
- ``float64 total_time`` Number describing the total duration (seconds) of all reference signals. Supports ``inf`` for continuous publishing.

Please note that, although some inputs are specific for a certain type of signal, all arrays must be supplied with the same length during the service call, filling the unused fields with any arbitrary value.

### Response arguments

- ``success`` Boolean output to indicate whether or not the reference signal was successfully published.
- ``message`` String to give more detailed information about the service call.
